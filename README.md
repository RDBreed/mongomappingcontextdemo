This project demonstrates the difference in MongoMappingContext's persistent entities when using different configurations. Running the tests will 
show these differences. The three different test setups are as follows:
- Application without Configuration
- Application with simple Configuration
- Application with Configuration, with EnableMongoRepositories annotation
